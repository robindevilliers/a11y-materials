        In order to configure an icon, click on the link above, and the Bootstrap Icon website will open.

        If you browse downwards in that page, you will find an extensive list of icons with their names supplied.

        Simply supply the name on the left with whichever name you would like from the website.

        If you require an icon that is not included in the list, please consult the web developers.
