        To comply with the regulations governing cookies under the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive you must:
                1. Receive usersâ€™ consent before you use any cookies except strictly necessary cookies.
                2. Provide accurate and specific information about the data each cookie tracks and its purpose in plain
                        language before consent is received.
                3. Document and store consent received from users.
                4. Allow users to access your service even if they refuse to allow the use of certain cookies
                5. Make it as easy for users to withdraw their consent as it was for them to give their consent in the first place.

        Blue-top do not currently support maintaining a user's choice over the use of elective cookies (such as tracking cookies),
        so for now all such cookie usage should be prohibited, if targeted to the EU.  This feature is in the backlog.
