improve error handling as source mapping will not work.

one of the style guide pages is different so I have an error in the binders somewhere.

add unit tests for the renderingEngine.

we need field validation in the ftl files.  There is a contract between the ftl and the renderer, and we want to
express the contract when an error occurs.

reference docs.

remove preserveLink and use test store to substitute on click events.
